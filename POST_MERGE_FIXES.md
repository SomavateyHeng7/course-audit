# Post-Merge Fixes Applied

## Issues Resolved:

### 1. ✅ "faculties.map is not a function" Error
**Problem**: AuthForm component was trying to use `data` directly instead of `data.faculties`
**Fix**: Updated AuthForm.tsx line 26 to use `setFaculties(data.faculties)`

### 2. ✅ Anonymous Access to Student Page
**Problem**: Middleware was redirecting unauthenticated users away from `/student`
**Fix**: Added `/student` to public paths in middleware.ts

### 3. ✅ Hardcoded Faculties in Student Page
**Problem**: Student page had hardcoded faculty and department options
**Fix**: 
- Added state management for faculties and departments
- Implemented API fetching for both faculties and departments
- Added proper loading states and error handling
- Made departments filter based on selected faculty

### 4. ✅ Schema Role Enum Mismatch
**Problem**: Schema had `ADMIN` but code was using `SUPER_ADMIN`
**Fix**: Updated schema.prisma to use `SUPER_ADMIN` to match existing codebase

### 5. ✅ Generic Content Updates
**Problem**: Student page had hardcoded, specific course/department references
**Fix**: Made content more generic and applicable to all programs

## Database Changes Applied:
- ✅ Updated Role enum from `ADMIN` to `SUPER_ADMIN`
- ✅ Pushed schema changes to database with `npx prisma db push`

## API Endpoints Verified:
- ✅ `/api/faculties` - Returns `{ faculties: [...] }`
- ✅ `/api/departments` - Returns `{ departments: [...] }` with faculty relations

## Files Modified:
1. `src/components/shared/AuthForm.tsx` - Fixed faculties API handling
2. `src/middleware.ts` - Added `/student` to public paths
3. `src/app/student/page.tsx` - Removed hardcoded data, added API fetching
4. `prisma/schema.prisma` - Updated Role enum to SUPER_ADMIN

## Testing Status:
- ✅ No TypeScript errors in modified files
- ✅ Database schema synchronized
- ✅ Anonymous access to student page enabled
- ✅ Dynamic faculty/department loading implemented

## Key Architectural Decisions Maintained:
- ✅ Department-scoped course types (vs faculty-scoped from incoming branch)
- ✅ Category strings for elective rules (vs complex relationships)
- ✅ Curriculum uniqueness by department
- ✅ All audit logging and constraint features preserved

The system should now properly handle anonymous browsing with dynamic faculty/department data while maintaining all the enhanced features from the merge.
