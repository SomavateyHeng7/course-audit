# Course Categorization Fix - Summary

## Issue Identified
From console logs, we discovered that:
- **General Education courses**: Correctly categorized ✅
- **Major and Core courses**: All being categorized as "Free Elective" ❌

## Root Cause
The `StudentTranscriptImport` component was using `curriculumConstraints` to categorize courses, but:
1. Constraints might not be properly configured in the database
2. Courses not found in constraints were defaulting to "General"
3. During categorization, unmatched courses were being put in "Free Elective"

## Solution Applied
Updated `fetchCurriculumStructure` function in `StudentTranscriptImport.tsx` to:

1. **Use courseType directly**: Instead of relying on constraints, use `course.courseType.name`
2. **Remove constraint logic**: Simplified to use the database courseType field
3. **Added debugging**: Console logs to track categorization process

## Code Changes
```typescript
// OLD: Using constraints (unreliable)
for (const constraint of constraints) {
  const category = mapConstraintTypeToCategory(constraint.type);
  // ... complex constraint processing
}

// NEW: Using courseType directly (reliable)
curriculumCourses.forEach((currCourse: any) => {
  const course = currCourse.course;
  const category = course.courseType?.name || 'General';
  // ... direct categorization
});
```

## Expected Result
After this fix:
- **Major courses** (CSX3010, CSX3001, etc.) should appear in "Major" category
- **Core courses** (CSX2003, ITX2005, etc.) should appear in "Core" category  
- **General Education courses** should remain in "General Education" category

## Testing
1. Upload `curriculum_courses_transcript.csv`
2. Check console for new logs: "Course [code]: courseType = [type], category = [category]"
3. Verify import analysis shows courses in correct categories
4. Apply and verify courses appear with correct status in their proper sections
