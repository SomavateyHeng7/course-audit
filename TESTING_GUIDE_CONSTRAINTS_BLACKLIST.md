## üîß Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Issue 1: No Validation Warnings Appear
- **Check**: Curriculum has assigned blacklists/constraints
- **Check**: Student data is properly loaded
- **Check**: Browser console for validation errors

### Issue 2: Incorrect Course Categories
- **Check**: Curriculum departmentCourseTypes mapping
- **Check**: Course data includes proper department course type
- **Check**: API returns correct course structure

### Issue 3: Wrong Credit Calculations
- **Check**: Credit parsing from "2-0-4" format to individual numbers
- **Check**: Course credits are numeric, not concatenated strings
- **Check**: Total calculations use parsed credit values
