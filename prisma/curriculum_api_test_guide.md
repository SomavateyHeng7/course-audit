## Curriculum Creation API Test Guide

### üéØ **Overview**
The curriculum creation API supports the ownership model where:
- **Global Course Pool**: All courses accessible by all chairpersons
- **Private Curricula**: Each curriculum is private to its creator
- **Course Updates**: Changes to courses apply globally
- **Curriculum Configuration**: Constraints and rules are curriculum-specific

### üìã **API Endpoints Created**

#### **1. Curriculum Management**
- `GET /api/curricula` - List curricula for current user
- `POST /api/curricula` - Create new curriculum with courses
- `GET /api/curricula/[id]` - Get specific curriculum
- `PUT /api/curricula/[id]` - Update curriculum
- `DELETE /api/curricula/[id]` - Delete curriculum

#### **2. Course Management**
- `GET /api/courses` - Search and list all courses (global pool)
- `POST /api/courses` - Create new course in global pool
- `GET /api/courses/search` - Optimized search for frontend components

### üîç **Key Features Implemented**

#### **‚úÖ Global Course Pool**
- Courses are accessible by all chairpersons
- Course codes are globally unique (e.g., CS101, ITX3001)
- Course updates apply to the global database
- Search functionality across all courses

#### **‚úÖ Private Curriculum Ownership**
- Each curriculum belongs to its creator (`createdById`)
- Only the creator can view, edit, or delete their curricula
- Curriculum constraints and rules are private
- Proper access control validation

#### **‚úÖ Comprehensive Audit Trail**
- All actions logged in `AuditLog` table
- Track course creation, curriculum creation, searches
- Include before/after values for updates
- Context linking to related entities

#### **‚úÖ Advanced Course Management**
- Course prerequisites and corequisites support
- Senior standing requirements with credit thresholds
- Course categorization and filtering
- Curriculum-specific course configuration (required, semester, year, position)

#### **‚úÖ Flexible Constraint System**
- JSON-based constraint configuration
- Support for multiple constraint types:
  - `SENIOR_STANDING` (with credit threshold)
  - `MINIMUM_GPA`
  - `TOTAL_CREDITS`
  - `CATEGORY_CREDITS`
  - `CUSTOM`

#### **‚úÖ Elective Rules Management**
- Category-based elective requirements
- Credit requirements per category
- Flexible rule descriptions

### üõ† **Database Schema Support**

The enhanced schema fully supports:
- ‚úÖ **20 Models** with proper relationships
- ‚úÖ **5 New Tables**: `CoursePrerequisite`, `CourseCorequisite`, `CurriculumConstraint`, `AuditLog`, `SystemSetting`
- ‚úÖ **Strategic Indexes** for performance
- ‚úÖ **Cascade Deletion** for data integrity
- ‚úÖ **Unique Constraints** for ownership model
- ‚úÖ **Proper Enums** for type safety

### üîÑ **Next Steps**

1. **Frontend Integration**: Connect existing frontend components to these APIs
2. **Constraint Management**: Implement constraint validation during curriculum audit
3. **Prerequisites/Corequisites**: Add APIs for managing course relationships
4. **Bulk Operations**: Excel import/export functionality
5. **Advanced Search**: Full-text search across courses and curricula

The curriculum creation API is now **fully functional** and ready for integration with the existing frontend components!
