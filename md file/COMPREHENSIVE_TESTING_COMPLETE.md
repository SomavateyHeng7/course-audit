## 🔍 **ARCHITECTURAL DECISIONS VERIFIED**

### **✅ Faculty-Wide Collaborative Access Pattern**
```typescript
// ✅ IMPLEMENTED EVERYWHERE - Verified Pattern
const user = await prisma.user.findUnique({
  where: { id: session.user.id },
  include: { 
    department: {
      include: {
        faculty: {
          include: {
            departments: true
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
});

const facultyDepartmentIds = user.department.faculty.departments.map(d => d.id);

// Faculty-wide access control
where: {
  departmentId: {
    in: facultyDepartmentIds  // Access all departments in same faculty
  }
}
```

### **✅ Cross-Faculty Security Isolation**
- ✅ **Verified**: Users cannot access resources from other faculties
- ✅ **Verified**: Department ownership is preserved for all resources
- ✅ **Verified**: All queries properly filter by faculty department IDs

### **✅ Course Architecture Decision**
**Analysis**: Courses are intentionally global resources without direct department association.
- **Reasoning**: Courses can be reused across departments (e.g., Math, English)
- **Department Scoping**: Applied through `DepartmentCourseType` for categorization
- **Decision**: ✅ **CORRECT** - Course endpoints remain global as designed

---

## 🚦 **ENDPOINTS STATUS BY CATEGORY**

### **✅ DEPARTMENT-SCOPED RESOURCES (All Complete)**
**Core Resources**: Curricula, Blacklists, Concentrations, Course Types
**Sub-Resources**: Constraints, Elective Rules, Curriculum Assignments
**Access Pattern**: Faculty-wide collaborative access
**Status**: ✅ **100% IMPLEMENTED**

### **🔒 GLOBAL RESOURCES (Intentionally Global)**
**Resources**: Courses, Faculties, Departments
**Access Pattern**: Global with appropriate role-based access
**Status**: ✅ **CORRECT AS-IS**

### **🔓 AUTHENTICATION & ADMIN (No Department Scoping)**
**Resources**: Auth endpoints, Admin endpoints, Test endpoints
**Access Pattern**: Role-based or global access
**Status**: ✅ **CORRECT AS-IS**

---

## 📈 **PERFORMANCE & SECURITY VERIFICATION**

### **✅ Query Optimization**
