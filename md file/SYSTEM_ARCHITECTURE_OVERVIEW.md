- Complete isolation between different faculties
- Department defaults with override capabilities

### **Progressive Enhancement**
- Anonymous users can explore without registration
- Authenticated users get persistent progress tracking
- Role-based feature activation
- Graceful degradation for different access levels

### **Bulk Data Processing**
- Excel/CSV import with comprehensive validation
- Multi-step curriculum creation workflow
- Bulk course assignment operations
- Error handling and rollback capabilities

### **Academic Rules Engine**
- Complex prerequisite and co-requisite validation
- GPA and credit requirement checking
- Graduation timeline calculation
- Flexible elective rule configuration

This architecture supports a scalable, secure, and user-friendly academic management system with comprehensive progress tracking and institutional curriculum management capabilities.
