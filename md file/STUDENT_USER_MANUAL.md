## Data Privacy & Anonymous Usage

### Anonymous Access Benefits
EduTrack operates as an **anonymous system**, meaning:
- **No personal information required** - no registration, email, or login needed
- **Complete privacy** - your academic data stays on your device
- **No data collection** - the system doesn't store or transmit your information
- **Immediate access** - start using the system right away

### How Data Storage Works

#### Local Browser Storage
- **All data stored locally** in your browser's localStorage
- **No server storage** - your information never leaves your device
- **Browser-specific** - data is tied to the specific browser you use
- **Device-specific** - switching devices means starting fresh

#### Data Persistence
- **Automatic saving** - your progress is saved as you work
- **Session continuity** - data persists between browser sessions
- **No expiration** - data stays until you clear it or browser cache is cleared

### Important Considerations

#### Data Backup Recommendations
Since your data is stored locally:
1. **Regular exports** - Download Excel files frequently as backup
2. **PDF reports** - Generate progress reports for permanent records
3. **Multiple devices** - Export and re-import data when switching devices
4. **Browser updates** - Export data before major browser updates

#### Data Limitations
- **Single browser only** - data doesn't sync across browsers
- **No cloud storage** - no automatic backup to cloud services
- **Device dependent** - new device means starting over (unless you import backup)
- **Browser data** - clearing browser data will erase your progress

#### Data Transfer Process
To move your data to a new browser or device:
1. **Export from old browser**: Download Excel file with all course data
2. **Access new browser**: Navigate to EduTrack on new device/browser
3. **Set up program**: Select faculty, department, curriculum, concentration
4. **Import data**: Use transcript import feature with your exported Excel file

### Privacy Assurance
- **No tracking** - system doesn't track user behavior
- **No analytics** - no data collection for system improvement
- **No third parties** - no data shared with external services
- **Local only** - all processing happens in your browser

### Best Practices for Anonymous Usage
1. **Bookmark the system** - save the URL for easy access
2. **Use consistent browser** - stick to one browser for continuity
3. **Regular backups** - export data weekly or after major updates
4. **Document curriculum info** - note your selections for future reference
5. **Share exported data carefully** - files contain your academic information
