# Course Import Debugging - Step by Step

## Current Issue
- Transcript import analysis shows 5 matched courses
- Only General Education courses show as "Completed" with grades
- Major and Core courses still show "Not Completed"

## Debugging Steps Added

### 1. Enhanced Transcript Import Logging
The `handleCategorizedCoursesImported` function now logs:
- Each category being processed
- Each course with its details (code, title, found status, status, grade)
- Complete course codes being added to state

### 2. Course Rendering Debug Info
Each course now displays:
- "Found: YES/NO" - whether the course exists in completedCourses state
- Current status if found

## Test Instructions

1. **Upload the `curriculum_courses_transcript.csv`**
2. **Check Console Logs** for:
   - "Processing category: [category name]"
   - "Processing course: [course details]"
   - "Adding course to completed: [course code]"
   - "All course codes in state: [array of codes]"

3. **Check UI Debug Info** - Each course should show "Found: YES/NO"

## Expected Behavior
All courses from the CSV should show:
- **General Education**: Found: YES (completed)
- **Major**: Found: YES (completed) 
- **Core**: Found: YES (completed)

## Potential Issues to Look For

### Issue 1: Course Code Mismatch
- CSV codes: `CSX3010`, `CSX3011`, etc.
- Curriculum codes might be different format
- **Fix**: Check console logs for exact codes

### Issue 2: Category Processing Problem
- Only first category being processed correctly
- **Fix**: Check "Processing category" logs

### Issue 3: State Update Issue
- Courses added to state but not persisting
- **Fix**: Check "All course codes in state" log

### Issue 4: Rendering Logic Problem
- State correct but UI not updating
- **Fix**: Check "Found: YES/NO" debug info

## Quick Test
After uploading CSV, in browser console run:
```javascript
// Check what courses are in the completed state
console.log('Completed courses state:', window.completedCourses || 'Not accessible');
```

## Next Steps Based on Results

**If console shows all courses being added but UI shows "Found: NO":**
- Course code format mismatch between import and curriculum

**If console shows only General Education being processed:**
- Category processing issue in import logic

**If all logs look correct but status doesn't persist:**
- React state update issue

**If UI shows "Found: YES" but status is still "Not Completed":**
- StatusDropdown component issue
