## Key Changes from Original Diagram

### ✅ **Added (Missing Junction Tables):**
1. **CURRICULUM_COURSE** - Junction between CURRICULUM and COURSE
2. **BLACKLIST_COURSE** - Junction between BLACKLIST and COURSE  
3. **CONCENTRATION_COURSE** - Junction between CONCENTRATION and COURSE
4. **ELECTIVE_RULE_COURSE** - Junction between ELECTIVE_RULE and COURSE

### ✅ **Kept (As Requested):**
- **FACULTY → USER** relationship (offers) maintained

### ✅ **Removed:**
- ~~USER → DEPARTMENT_COURSE_TYPE~~ (incorrect relationship - this junction has no createdById)

### ✅ **Enhanced:**
- All entities now show key attributes
- Junction tables properly displayed
- Self-referencing COURSE relationships (prerequisites/corequisites) shown
- Proper cardinality notation (||--o{) for one-to-many relationships
