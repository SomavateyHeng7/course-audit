# Schema Comparison - Current vs Incoming Branch

## Key Differences Found and Resolved:

### âœ… Fixed Issues:
1. **Role Enum**: Changed `ADMIN` back to `SUPER_ADMIN` to match existing code
2. **Faculty API Response**: Fixed `faculties.map` error in AuthForm component - now correctly uses `data.faculties`
3. **Student Page**: Removed hardcoded faculties/departments, now fetches from API
4. **Middleware**: Added `/student` to public paths for anonymous access

### âœ… Correctly Maintained (Different from Incoming Branch by Design):
1. **Course.category Field**: REMOVED - We moved to department-scoped course types instead
2. **CourseType Relationship**: 
   - Incoming: `CourseType` â†’ `Faculty` (facultyId)
   - Current: `CourseType` â†’ `Department` (departmentId) 
   - This is correct for our department-scoped approach

### âœ… Key Features Preserved:
1. **Department-scoped Course Types**: `DepartmentCourseType` model with proper relationships
2. **Course Type Assignment**: Users can assign course types to courses within departments
3. **Curriculum Uniqueness**: `@@unique([year, startId, endId, departmentId])` 
4. **Elective Rules**: Uses category strings instead of complex relationships
5. **All Constraint Types**: `CurriculumConstraintType` enum with all constraint types
6. **Student Course Tracking**: Full `StudentCourse` model with status tracking
7. **Audit Logging**: Complete audit trail for all actions

### ðŸ“‹ Schema Structure Status:
- âœ… All core models present and correctly related
- âœ… All enums defined properly (Role, CurriculumConstraintType, StudentCourseStatus, AuditAction)
- âœ… Proper cascading deletes where appropriate
- âœ… Correct indexes for performance
- âœ… All unique constraints in place

### ðŸ”§ Recent Fixes Applied:
1. Fixed `TypeError: faculties.map is not a function` in AuthForm
2. Added dynamic faculty/department loading in student page
3. Updated middleware to allow anonymous access to `/student` route
4. Synchronized Role enum with existing codebase usage

## Conclusion:
The current schema is properly structured and maintains all the intended functionality. The differences from the incoming branch are intentional design decisions that improve the system architecture (department-scoped course types vs faculty-scoped).
