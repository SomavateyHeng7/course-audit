# User-Department Association Architecture Analysis & Implementation Plan

## Current Implementation Status

### üîç **Current User Association Model**
- ‚ùå **Users are ONLY associated with Faculty** (`User.facultyId`)
- ‚ùå **No direct Department association** for Users
- ‚ö†Ô∏è  **Chairpersons need to manually select department** during curriculum creation

### üîç **Current Entity-Department Relationships**
1. **‚úÖ Blacklists**: Associated with `departmentId` + `createdById` (department-scoped)
2. **‚úÖ Concentrations**: Associated with `departmentId` + `createdById` (department-scoped)  
3. **‚úÖ Course Types**: Associated with `departmentId` (department-scoped)
4. **‚úÖ Curricula**: Associated with `departmentId` (department-scoped)
5. **‚úÖ Elective Rules**: Associated with `curriculumId` (curriculum-scoped, inherits department via curriculum)

### üîç **Current Uniqueness Constraints**
- **Blacklists**: `@@unique([name, departmentId, createdById])` ‚úÖ Department-scoped
- **Concentrations**: `@@unique([name, departmentId, createdById])` ‚úÖ Department-scoped
- **Course Types**: `@@unique([name, departmentId])` ‚úÖ Department-scoped
- **Curricula**: `@@unique([year, startId, endId, departmentId])` ‚úÖ Department-scoped
- **Elective Rules**: `@@unique([curriculumId, category])` ‚úÖ Curriculum-scoped (inherits department)
- **DepartmentCourseType**: `@@unique([courseId, departmentId])` ‚úÖ Department-scoped

## üö® **Issues Identified**

### **1. User-Department Association Gap**
```prisma
model User {
  facultyId String  // ‚úÖ Has faculty association
  // ‚ùå MISSING: departmentId String?
}
```

**Problems:**
- Chairpersons must manually select department during curriculum creation
- No automatic department context for user actions
- Potential for cross-department access issues

### **2. Authentication Flow Incomplete**
- **Current**: Users select Faculty during signup
- **Missing**: Users should also select Department
- **Impact**: Manual department selection in every operation

### **3. Performance Concerns**
- Course type assignments could be retrieved for wrong departments
- Queries may need additional department filtering
- Cross-department data leakage possible

---

## üìã **Implementation Plan**

### **Phase 1: Schema Updates** üî¥ **REQUIRED**

#### **1.1 Add Department Association to Users**
```prisma
model User {
  id           String  @id @default(cuid())
  email        String  @unique
  password     String
  name         String
  role         Role    @default(STUDENT)
  facultyId    String
  departmentId String? // üÜï Add department association (nullable for backwards compatibility)
  advisorId    String?
  // ... rest of fields

  faculty    Faculty     @relation(fields: [facultyId], references: [id])
  department Department? @relation(fields: [departmentId], references: [id]) // üÜï Add relation
  // ... rest of relations

  @@map("users")
}
```

#### **1.2 Update Department Model**
```prisma
model Department {
  // ... existing fields
  users User[] // üÜï Add reverse relation
  // ... rest of relations
}
```

### **Phase 2: Authentication Flow Updates** üî¥ **REQUIRED**

#### **2.1 Update AuthForm Component**
- Add department selection after faculty selection
- Filter departments based on selected faculty
- Make departmentId required for CHAIRPERSON role
- Optional for STUDENT/ADVISOR roles

#### **2.2 Update Signup API**
- Accept `departmentId` in registration payload
- Validate department belongs to selected faculty
- Enforce department selection for chairpersons

### **Phase 3: Curriculum Creation Simplification** üü° **OPTIONAL**

#### **Option A: Auto-Associate with User's Department**
```typescript
// Remove manual department selection
const userDepartmentId = session.user.department.id;
// Auto-use user's department for curriculum creation
```

#### **Option B: Keep Manual Selection (More Flexible)**
```typescript
// Keep current department selection
// Allows chairpersons to create curricula for multiple departments if needed
// Validate user has permission for selected department
```

**Recommendation**: **Option A** - Simpler UX, most chairpersons work within their own department

### **Phase 4: Data Access Security** üî¥ **REQUIRED**

#### **4.1 Add Department-based Access Control**
- Chairpersons can only access their department's data
- Add middleware checks for department access
- Update all API routes to filter by user's department

#### **4.2 Update Existing Queries**
```typescript
// Before (potential cross-department access)
const blacklists = await prisma.blacklist.findMany({
  where: { createdById: userId }
});

// After (department-scoped)
const blacklists = await prisma.blacklist.findMany({
  where: { 
    createdById: userId,
    departmentId: user.departmentId 
  }
});
```

---

## üéØ **Current Implementation Status Check**

### **‚úÖ Already Correct (Department-Scoped)**
1. **Blacklists**: `departmentId` + unique per department ‚úÖ
2. **Concentrations**: `departmentId` + unique per department ‚úÖ
3. **Course Types**: `departmentId` + unique per department ‚úÖ
4. **Course Type Assignments**: `DepartmentCourseType` with `departmentId` ‚úÖ
5. **Elective Rules**: Curriculum-scoped (inherits department) ‚úÖ

### **‚ùå Needs Fixing**
1. **Users**: Missing `departmentId` association ‚ùå
2. **Authentication**: No department selection ‚ùå
3. **API Access Control**: No department filtering in some routes ‚ùå
4. **TypeScript Error**: Department model trying to count non-existent `users` relation ‚ùå

---

## ‚ö° **Performance Implications**

### **Positive Impacts**
- **Better Query Performance**: Department-scoped queries are more efficient
- **Reduced Data Transfer**: Only relevant department data loaded
- **Improved Security**: Automatic department-based access control

### **Potential Concerns**
- **Migration Complexity**: Existing users need department assignment
- **Additional Joins**: User queries now need department relation
- **Index Requirements**: New indexes needed for `(userId, departmentId)` patterns

### **Recommended Indexes**
```prisma
// Add these indexes after implementation
@@index([departmentId, createdById]) // For created entities
@@index([facultyId, departmentId])   // For user lookups
```

---

## ü§î **Questions & Decisions Needed**

### **1. User-Department Relationship**
**Question**: Should `User.departmentId` be required or optional?
- **Option A**: Required for CHAIRPERSON, optional for others
- **Option B**: Required for all users
- **Recommendation**: Option A (more flexible)

### **2. Cross-Department Access**
**Question**: Should chairpersons access other departments within their faculty?
- **Current**: They can select any department during curriculum creation
- **Proposed**: Restrict to their own department only
- **Recommendation**: Restrict for security, add admin override if needed

### **3. Migration Strategy**
**Question**: How to handle existing users without departmentId?
- **Option A**: Default to first department in their faculty
- **Option B**: Force manual assignment during next login
- **Recommendation**: Option A with notification

### **4. Admin vs Chairperson Creation**
**Question**: Should account creation be admin-only or allow chairperson self-signup?
- **Current**: Chairpersons can self-signup
- **Recommended**: Keep current for simplicity, add admin management later

---

## üöÄ **Optimal Implementation Flow**

Based on requirements clarification:
- **User Types**: Only SUPER_ADMIN (seeded) and CHAIRPERSON (signup-able)
- **Department Selection**: Default to associated department but selectable  
- **Department Association**: Required for all CHAIRPERSONs

### **Phase 1: Schema & Database Changes** (Day 1)

#### **1.1 Update User Schema**
```prisma
model User {
  id           String  @id @default(cuid())
  email        String  @unique
  password     String
  name         String
  role         Role    @default(CHAIRPERSON) // Changed default since only CHAIRPERSON signup
  facultyId    String
  departmentId String  // üÜï REQUIRED for chairpersons (not nullable)
  advisorId    String? // Keep for future use
  gpa          Float?
  credits      Int?
  scholarshipHour Int?
  createdAt    DateTime @default(now())
  updatedAt    DateTime @updatedAt
  
  // Relations
  faculty      Faculty    @relation(fields: [facultyId], references: [id])
  department   Department @relation(fields: [departmentId], references: [id]) // ÔøΩ Required relation
  advisor      User?      @relation("AdvisorStudent", fields: [advisorId], references: [id])
  students     User[]     @relation("AdvisorStudent")
  
  // Existing relations
  auditLogs             AuditLog[]
  blacklists            Blacklist[]            @relation("BlacklistCreator")
  concentrations        Concentration[]        @relation("ConcentrationCreator") 
  curricula             Curriculum[]           @relation("CurriculumCreator")
  courseTypeAssignments DepartmentCourseType[] @relation("CourseTypeAssignments")
  studentCourses        StudentCourse[]

  @@map("users")
}

model Department {
  // ... existing fields
  users User[] // üÜï Add reverse relation
  // ... rest of relations
}
```

#### **1.2 Database Migration**
```sql
-- Add departmentId column (initially nullable for migration)
ALTER TABLE users ADD COLUMN department_id TEXT;

-- Update existing users to have a default department
-- (assign to first department of their faculty)
UPDATE users 
SET department_id = (
  SELECT d.id 
  FROM departments d 
  WHERE d.faculty_id = users.faculty_id 
  LIMIT 1
) 
WHERE role = 'CHAIRPERSON';

-- Make departmentId NOT NULL for chairpersons
ALTER TABLE users ALTER COLUMN department_id SET NOT NULL 
WHERE role = 'CHAIRPERSON';

-- Add foreign key constraint
ALTER TABLE users ADD CONSTRAINT users_department_id_fkey 
FOREIGN KEY (department_id) REFERENCES departments(id);
```

#### **1.3 Update Role Enum Usage**
- Remove STUDENT and ADVISOR from active signup flows
- Keep enum values for future use
- Update default role to CHAIRPERSON

### **Phase 2: Authentication Flow Updates** (Day 1-2)

#### **2.1 Update AuthForm Component**
```typescript
// Add state for department selection
const [departments, setDepartments] = useState<Department[]>([]);
const [selectedFaculty, setSelectedFaculty] = useState('');
const [selectedDepartment, setSelectedDepartment] = useState('');

// Filter departments based on selected faculty
const filteredDepartments = departments.filter(dept => 
  dept.facultyId === selectedFaculty
);

// Make department selection required
const isFormValid = email && password && name && selectedFaculty && selectedDepartment;
```

#### **2.2 Update Registration API**
```typescript
// src/app/api/auth/register/route.ts
export async function POST(req: NextRequest) {
  const { email, password, name, facultyId, departmentId } = await req.json();
  
  // Validate required fields (including departmentId)
  if (!departmentId) {
    return NextResponse.json({ error: 'Department selection is required' }, { status: 400 });
  }
  
  // Validate department belongs to faculty
  const department = await prisma.department.findFirst({
    where: { id: departmentId, facultyId }
  });
  
  if (!department) {
    return NextResponse.json({ error: 'Invalid department for selected faculty' }, { status: 400 });
  }
  
  // Create user with department association
  const user = await prisma.user.create({
    data: {
      email,
      password: await hash(password, 10),
      name,
      role: 'CHAIRPERSON', // Default role
      facultyId,
      departmentId, // Required field
    }
  });
}
```

### **Phase 3: UI Flow Updates** (Day 2)

#### **3.1 Curriculum Creation - Smart Default with Override**
```typescript
// src/app/chairperson/create/details/page.tsx
const [selectedDepartmentId, setSelectedDepartmentId] = useState<string>('');

// Auto-set user's department as default
useEffect(() => {
  if (session?.user?.departmentId && !selectedDepartmentId) {
    setSelectedDepartmentId(session.user.departmentId);
  }
}, [session, selectedDepartmentId]);

// UI: Show user's department as default but allow change
<div className="mb-4 p-4 bg-blue-50 border border-blue-200 rounded-lg">
  <div className="flex items-center gap-2 mb-2">
    <InfoIcon className="w-4 h-4 text-blue-600" />
    <span className="text-sm font-medium text-blue-800">Default Department</span>
  </div>
  <p className="text-sm text-blue-700">
    Creating curriculum for <strong>{userDepartment?.name}</strong>. 
    You can select a different department if needed.
  </p>
</div>

<select 
  value={selectedDepartmentId}
  onChange={(e) => setSelectedDepartmentId(e.target.value)}
  className="..."
>
  <option value={session.user.departmentId}>
    {userDepartment?.name} (Your Department) ‚≠ê
  </option>
  {otherDepartments.map(dept => (
    <option key={dept.id} value={dept.id}>
      {dept.name}
    </option>
  ))}
</select>
```

#### **3.2 Access Control Updates**
```typescript
// Add department-based filtering but allow cross-department access for flexibility
const getUserAccessibleDepartments = (user: User) => {
  if (user.role === 'SUPER_ADMIN') {
    return 'ALL_DEPARTMENTS';
  }
  
  // Chairpersons get their own department + other departments in same faculty
  return {
    primaryDepartment: user.departmentId,
    facultyDepartments: user.faculty.departments.map(d => d.id)
  };
};
```

### **Phase 4: Security & Performance** (Day 3)

#### **4.1 API Route Security Updates**
```typescript
// Add department validation middleware
const validateDepartmentAccess = async (userId: string, departmentId: string) => {
  const user = await prisma.user.findUnique({
    where: { id: userId },
    include: { faculty: { include: { departments: true } } }
  });
  
  if (user?.role === 'SUPER_ADMIN') return true;
  
  // Allow access to own department or any department in same faculty
  const facultyDepartmentIds = user?.faculty.departments.map(d => d.id) || [];
  return facultyDepartmentIds.includes(departmentId);
};

// Apply to all department-scoped endpoints
export async function GET(req: NextRequest) {
  const { departmentId } = await req.json();
  const session = await getServerSession(authOptions);
  
  const hasAccess = await validateDepartmentAccess(session.user.id, departmentId);
  if (!hasAccess) {
    return NextResponse.json({ error: 'Access denied' }, { status: 403 });
  }
  
  // Proceed with request...
}
```

#### **4.2 Performance Optimizations**
```typescript
// Add strategic indexes
@@index([departmentId, createdById]) // For created entities
@@index([facultyId, departmentId])   // For user lookups  
@@index([departmentId, role])        // For department user queries

// Optimize common queries
const getUserDashboardData = async (userId: string) => {
  const user = await prisma.user.findUnique({
    where: { id: userId },
    include: {
      department: {
        include: {
          curricula: { take: 5, orderBy: { updatedAt: 'desc' } },
          blacklists: { take: 5 },
          concentrations: { take: 5 }
        }
      }
    }
  });
  
  return user;
};
```

## üéØ **Clarification on Implementation Points**

### **Point 4 Elaboration: "Can you elaborate on this?"**

I believe you're asking about the **department-based access control and its implications**. Here's a detailed breakdown:

#### **Current State vs Proposed State**

**Current Problem:**
```typescript
// ‚ùå Current: No department-based security
const blacklists = await prisma.blacklist.findMany({
  where: { createdById: userId } // Could access any department's data
});
```

**Proposed Solution:**
```typescript
// ‚úÖ Proposed: Department-aware security
const blacklists = await prisma.blacklist.findMany({
  where: { 
    departmentId: { in: userAccessibleDepartmentIds }, // Scoped to allowed departments
    createdById: userId 
  }
});
```

#### **Access Control Levels Explained**

1. **SUPER_ADMIN Access** üîì
   ```typescript
   // Can access ALL departments across ALL faculties
   const accessLevel = 'GLOBAL';
   const accessibleDepartments = await prisma.department.findMany();
   ```

2. **CHAIRPERSON Access** üîí
   ```typescript
   // Can access ALL departments within THEIR faculty
   const accessLevel = 'FACULTY_SCOPED';
   const accessibleDepartments = await prisma.department.findMany({
     where: { facultyId: user.facultyId }
   });
   ```

3. **Default Behavior** ‚≠ê
   ```typescript
   // Primary department is auto-selected but user can choose others
   const defaultDepartment = user.departmentId;
   const selectableDepartments = user.faculty.departments;
   ```

#### **Why This Approach is Optimal**

1. **Security**: Prevents cross-faculty data access
2. **Flexibility**: Allows cross-department work within faculty
3. **Usability**: Smart defaults reduce clicks
4. **Performance**: Department-scoped queries are faster
5. **Scalability**: Works as university grows

#### **Specific Implementation Benefits**

**For Curriculum Creation:**
- ‚úÖ Auto-selects chairperson's department
- ‚úÖ Allows creating curricula for other departments in same faculty
- ‚úÖ Prevents accidental cross-faculty curriculum creation

**For Data Management:**
- ‚úÖ Blacklists/Concentrations default to user's department
- ‚úÖ Course types are properly department-scoped
- ‚úÖ All queries are automatically department-filtered for security

**For User Experience:**
- ‚úÖ Reduced cognitive load (smart defaults)
- ‚úÖ Maintained flexibility (can override defaults)
- ‚úÖ Clear visual indicators (shows "Your Department" ‚≠ê)

Is this the elaboration you were looking for, or did you want me to expand on a different aspect?
