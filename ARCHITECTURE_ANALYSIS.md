# User-Department Association Architecture Analysis & Implementation Plan

## Current Implementation Status

### 🔍 **Current User Association Model**
- ❌ **Users are ONLY associated with Faculty** (`User.facultyId`)
- ❌ **No direct Department association** for Users
- ⚠️  **Chairpersons need to manually select department** during curriculum creation

### 🔍 **Current Entity-Department Relationships**
1. **✅ Blacklists**: Associated with `departmentId` + `createdById` (department-scoped)
2. **✅ Concentrations**: Associated with `departmentId` + `createdById` (department-scoped)  
3. **✅ Course Types**: Associated with `departmentId` (department-scoped)
4. **✅ Curricula**: Associated with `departmentId` (department-scoped)
5. **✅ Elective Rules**: Associated with `curriculumId` (curriculum-scoped, inherits department via curriculum)

### 🔍 **Current Uniqueness Constraints**
- **Blacklists**: `@@unique([name, departmentId, createdById])` ✅ Department-scoped
- **Concentrations**: `@@unique([name, departmentId, createdById])` ✅ Department-scoped
- **Course Types**: `@@unique([name, departmentId])` ✅ Department-scoped
- **Curricula**: `@@unique([year, startId, endId, departmentId])` ✅ Department-scoped
- **Elective Rules**: `@@unique([curriculumId, category])` ✅ Curriculum-scoped (inherits department)
- **DepartmentCourseType**: `@@unique([courseId, departmentId])` ✅ Department-scoped

## 🚨 **Issues Identified**

### **1. User-Department Association Gap**
```prisma
model User {
  facultyId String  // ✅ Has faculty association
  // ❌ MISSING: departmentId String?
}
```

**Problems:**
- Chairpersons must manually select department during curriculum creation
- No automatic department context for user actions
- Potential for cross-department access issues

### **2. Authentication Flow Incomplete**
- **Current**: Users select Faculty during signup
- **Missing**: Users should also select Department
- **Impact**: Manual department selection in every operation

### **3. Performance Concerns**
- Course type assignments could be retrieved for wrong departments
- Queries may need additional department filtering
- Cross-department data leakage possible

---

## 📋 **Implementation Plan**

### **Phase 1: Schema Updates** 🔴 **REQUIRED**

#### **1.1 Add Department Association to Users**
```prisma
model User {
  id           String  @id @default(cuid())
  email        String  @unique
  password     String
  name         String
  role         Role    @default(STUDENT)
  facultyId    String
  departmentId String? // 🆕 Add department association (nullable for backwards compatibility)
  advisorId    String?
  // ... rest of fields

  faculty    Faculty     @relation(fields: [facultyId], references: [id])
  department Department? @relation(fields: [departmentId], references: [id]) // 🆕 Add relation
  // ... rest of relations

  @@map("users")
}
```

#### **1.2 Update Department Model**
```prisma
model Department {
  // ... existing fields
  users User[] // 🆕 Add reverse relation
  // ... rest of relations
}
```

### **Phase 2: Authentication Flow Updates** 🔴 **REQUIRED**

#### **2.1 Update AuthForm Component**
- Add department selection after faculty selection
- Filter departments based on selected faculty
- Make departmentId required for CHAIRPERSON role
- Optional for STUDENT/ADVISOR roles

#### **2.2 Update Signup API**
- Accept `departmentId` in registration payload
- Validate department belongs to selected faculty
- Enforce department selection for chairpersons

### **Phase 3: Curriculum Creation Simplification** 🟡 **OPTIONAL**

#### **Option A: Auto-Associate with User's Department**
```typescript
// Remove manual department selection
const userDepartmentId = session.user.department.id;
// Auto-use user's department for curriculum creation
```

#### **Option B: Keep Manual Selection (More Flexible)**
```typescript
// Keep current department selection
// Allows chairpersons to create curricula for multiple departments if needed
// Validate user has permission for selected department
```

**Recommendation**: **Option A** - Simpler UX, most chairpersons work within their own department

### **Phase 4: Data Access Security** 🔴 **REQUIRED**

#### **4.1 Add Department-based Access Control**
- Chairpersons can only access their department's data
- Add middleware checks for department access
- Update all API routes to filter by user's department

#### **4.2 Update Existing Queries**
```typescript
// Before (potential cross-department access)
const blacklists = await prisma.blacklist.findMany({
  where: { createdById: userId }
});

// After (department-scoped)
const blacklists = await prisma.blacklist.findMany({
  where: { 
    createdById: userId,
    departmentId: user.departmentId 
  }
});
```

## 🎯 **Current Implementation Status Check**

### **✅ Already Correct (Department-Scoped)**
1. **Blacklists**: `departmentId` + unique per department ✅
2. **Concentrations**: `departmentId` + unique per department ✅
3. **Course Types**: `departmentId` + unique per department ✅
4. **Course Type Assignments**: `DepartmentCourseType` with `departmentId` ✅
5. **Elective Rules**: Curriculum-scoped (inherits department) ✅

### **❌ Needs Fixing**
1. **Users**: Missing `departmentId` association ❌
2. **Authentication**: No department selection ❌
3. **API Access Control**: No department filtering in some routes ❌
4. **TypeScript Error**: Department model trying to count non-existent `users` relation ❌

## ⚡ **Performance Implications**

### **Positive Impacts**
- **Better Query Performance**: Department-scoped queries are more efficient
- **Reduced Data Transfer**: Only relevant department data loaded
- **Improved Security**: Automatic department-based access control

### **Potential Concerns**
- **Migration Complexity**: Existing users need department assignment
- **Additional Joins**: User queries now need department relation
- **Index Requirements**: New indexes needed for `(userId, departmentId)` patterns

### **Recommended Indexes**
```prisma
// Add these indexes after implementation
@@index([departmentId, createdById]) // For created entities
@@index([facultyId, departmentId])   // For user lookups
```

## 🤔 **Questions & Decisions Needed**

### **1. User-Department Relationship**
**Question**: Should `User.departmentId` be required or optional?
- **Option A**: Required for CHAIRPERSON, optional for others
- **Option B**: Required for all users
- **Recommendation**: Option A (more flexible)

### **2. Cross-Department Access**
**Question**: Should chairpersons access other departments within their faculty?
- **Current**: They can select any department during curriculum creation
- **Proposed**: Restrict to their own department only
- **Recommendation**: Restrict for security, add admin override if needed

### **3. Migration Strategy**
**Question**: How to handle existing users without departmentId?
- **Option A**: Default to first department in their faculty
- **Option B**: Force manual assignment during next login
- **Recommendation**: Option A with notification

### **4. Admin vs Chairperson Creation**
**Question**: Should account creation be admin-only or allow chairperson self-signup?
- **Current**: Chairpersons can self-signup
- **Recommended**: Keep current for simplicity, add admin management later

## 🏆 **Recommended Implementation Order**

1. **🔴 Priority 1**: Fix TypeScript error in departments API

3. **🔴 Priority 1**: Update AuthForm with department selection
4. **🔴 Priority 1**: Add department-based access control to APIs
5. **🟡 Priority 2**: Simplify curriculum creation (remove manual department selection)

**Estimated Development Time**: 2-3 days for Priority 1 items

## 💡 **Suggestions & Questions for Discussion**

1. **Should we implement all phases at once or gradually?**
2. **Do you want to keep manual department selection in curriculum creation for flexibility?**
3. **Should students/advisors also be required to have department associations?**
4. **How should we handle the migration of existing users without departments?**
5. **Do you want additional validation to ensure users can only access their department's data?**
