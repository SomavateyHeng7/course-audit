## ðŸ”§ **TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS**

### **Access Control Pattern**
```typescript
// Faculty-wide access control implementation
const user = await prisma.user.findUnique({
  where: { id: session.user.id },
  include: { 
    department: {
      include: {
        faculty: {
          include: {
            departments: true
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
});

// Get all department IDs within the user's faculty
const facultyDepartmentIds = user.department.faculty.departments.map(d => d.id);

// Apply faculty-wide access to queries
where: {
  id: resourceId,
  departmentId: {
    in: facultyDepartmentIds  // Can access all departments in faculty
  }
}
```

### **Key Features**
1. **Faculty-Wide Collaboration**: Users can access resources from all departments within their faculty
2. **Cross-Faculty Security**: Cannot access resources from other faculties
3. **Department Ownership**: Resources maintain their original department association
4. **Performance Optimization**: Strategic database indexes for efficient queries
5. **User Experience**: Smart defaults with clear visual indicators
